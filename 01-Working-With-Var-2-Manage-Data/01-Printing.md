## 01 - Print to Console + Take Input from Console 

### A): Printing to console with Python
- Using <u>***print()***</u> function
- Ex:
~~~python
print("Whatever string you want here")
# Will print all strings entered within the quotation marks
~~~

### B) Taking input from console
- Using <u>***input()***</u> function prompts an entry on terminal prior to exiting the code
- Ex:
~~~python
print(input("Typically a question goes here"))
# Input function is treated first. Prompt appears in terminal
# Print function prints out input captured then exits the code
~~~
